This unit is about introduction to object-oriented programming.

Please go through the video and slides first.

## Introduction to Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming is common among patterns found in software projects
and has support in moderm programming langusages.

## Midterm project

In a box on a 2 dimensional surface bounded by [-1, 1] on both x and y axis,
given m circles (they cannot overlap) with variable radius r and center (x_m, y_m),
find the optimal value of r and (x_m, y_m) which maximize sum of r^2.

1. Design an algorithm to solve the problem and use it as the comments in your code.
2. Implement your algorithm in C/C++/Python.
3. As usually, please comment the issue with the link to your solution.
